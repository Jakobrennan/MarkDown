Security updates
================

<div class="doc-box doc-notice">

Node.js vulnerabilities directly affect Express. Therefore [keep a watch
on Node.js vulnerabilities](http://blog.nodejs.org/vulnerability/) and
make sure you are using the latest stable version of Node.js.

</div>

The list below enumerates the Express vulnerabilities that were fixed in
the specified version update.

**NOTE**: If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in
Express, please see [Security Policies and
Procedures](/en/resources/contributing.html#security-policies-and-procedures).

4.x {#4x}
---

-   4.16.0
    -   The dependency `forwarded` has been updated to address a
        [vulnerability](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/527). This
        may affect your application if the following APIs are used:
        `req.host`, `req.hostname`, `req.ip`, `req.ips`, `req.protocol`.
    -   The dependency `mime` has been updated to address a
        [vulnerability](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/535), but
        this issue does not impact Express.
    -   The dependency `send` has been updated to provide a protection
        against a [Node.js 8.5.0
        vulnerability](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/september-2017-path-validation/).
        This only impacts running Express on the specific Node.js
        version 8.5.0.
-   4.15.5
    -   The dependency `debug` has been updated to address a
        [vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:debug:20170905), but
        this issue does not impact Express.
    -   The dependency `fresh` has been updated to address a
        [vulnerability](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/526). This
        will affect your application if the following APIs are used:
        `express.static`, `req.fresh`, `res.json`, `res.jsonp`,
        `res.send`, `res.sendfile` `res.sendFile`, `res.sendStatus`.
-   4.15.3
    -   The dependency `ms` has been updated to address a
        [vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ms:20170412). This may
        affect your application if untrusted string input is passed to
        the `maxAge` option in the following APIs: `express.static`,
        `res.sendfile`, and `res.sendFile`.
-   4.15.2
    -   The dependency `qs` has been updated to address a
        [vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:qs:20170213), but this
        issue does not impact Express. Updating to 4.15.2 is a good
        practice, but not required to address the vulnerability.
-   4.11.1
    -   Fixed root path disclosure vulnerability in `express.static`,
        `res.sendfile`, and `res.sendFile`
-   4.10.7
    -   Fixed open redirect vulnerability in `express.static`
        ([advisory](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/serve-static-open-redirect),
        [CVE-2015-1164](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1164)).
-   4.8.8
    -   Fixed directory traversal vulnerabilities in `express.static`
        ([advisory](http://nodesecurity.io/advisories/send-directory-traversal)
        ,
        [CVE-2014-6394](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6394)).
-   4.8.4
    -   Node.js 0.10 can leak `fd`s in certain situations that affect
        `express.static` and `res.sendfile`. Malicious requests could
        cause `fd`s to leak and eventually lead to `EMFILE` errors and
        server unresponsiveness.
-   4.8.0
    -   Sparse arrays that have extremely high indexes in the query
        string could cause the process to run out of memory and crash
        the server.
    -   Extremely nested query string objects could cause the process to
        block and make the server unresponsive temporarily.

-   3.16.6
    -   Node.js 0.10 can leak `fd`s in certain situations that affect

        server unresponsiveness.
-   3.16.0
    -   Sparse arrays that have extremely high indexes in query string
        could cause the process to run out of memory and crash
