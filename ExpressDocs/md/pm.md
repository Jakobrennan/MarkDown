Process managers for Express apps
=================================

When you run Express apps for production, it is helpful to use a
*process manager* to:

-   Restart the app automatically if it crashes.
-   Gain insights into runtime performance and resource consumption.
-   Modify settings dynamically to improve performance.
-   Control clustering.

A process manager is somewhat like an application server: it’s a
“container” for applications that facilitates deployment, provides high
availability, and enables you to manage the application at runtime.

The most popular process managers for Express and other Node.js
applications are:

-   **[Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever)**: A simple
    command-line interface tool to ensure that a script runs
    continuously (forever). Forever’s simple interface makes it ideal
    for running smaller deployments of Node.js apps and scripts.
-   **[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)**: A production process
    manager for Node.js applications that has a built-in load balancer.
    PM2 enables you to keep applications alive forever, reloads them
    without downtime, helps you to manage application logging,
    monitoring, and clustering.
-   **[StrongLoop Process Manager (Strong-PM)](http://strong-pm.io/)**:
    A production process manager for Node.js applications with built-in
    load balancing, monitoring, and multi-host deployment. Includes a
    CLI to build, package, and deploy Node.js applications to a local or
    remote system.
-   **SystemD**: The default process manager on modern Linux
    distributions, that makes it simple to run a Node application as
    a service. For more information, see [“Run node.js service with
    systemd” by Ralph
    Slooten (@axllent)](https://www.axllent.org/docs/view/nodejs-service-with-systemd/).
