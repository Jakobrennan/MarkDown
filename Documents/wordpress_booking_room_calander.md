# Room Booking project in wordpress

## basics

The main idea of this project is to create a booking system for the OGS building where all the employees of the building are able to book the meeting rooms without having to travel to the front desk and ask the receptionist. Granted this form of booking has worked for a long time but there is no need to it in this day and age. so we will be developing the calender within [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) due to it's usefulness today, and to help us (**the IDS Hub team **) get used to what we need to know and how we can use wordpress.

So 'plugins' are a little strange in wordpress (to me anyway). Wordpress is designed to be lightweight and lean, you really don't have to write a line of code unless you want to. the main point on word press is for you to choose a theme and then add onto the theme all the add-on's and wdigets that you think would be useful.
