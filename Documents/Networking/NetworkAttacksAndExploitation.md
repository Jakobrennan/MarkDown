# Computer Network attacks and Exploitations

### Computer Network Exploitation
since `sun tzu's - the art of war` people have been fighting for high ground. the aim of any combatting body is to gain advatage through better training, planning, research, development, executions and defense.
this applies for modern day computer netowork systems as they are valuable in what they hold and how they can be taken advantage of. For example, a database that holds information on your shopping habbits may not seem like the most lucrative system to take advantage of, however, the business you are shopping at will be taking advatnage of the things you like and dislike, whether you have pets or children. If you are interested in music or movies, they will use this information to create coupons that you can't refuse, which will end in that very business receiving your money and making a profit.
This thought process can be applied to any sort of computer system that might contain valuable information. Take the source code of the latest fighter jet for example. Or what about the e-mail content of a senate in america. If you could get ahold of the banking infromation of an individual through spoofing, would you?
all this information has lead to it's own subject in the education system, and you should be up to date with the terminology that is used.
there are 3 key aspects to understand when thinking about a computer network system.

##### Computer Network Exploitation (CNE)
exploiting a network entails entering the system, stealing data and not leaving a trace. This can be valuable information, like employees details and such, or it can be usefuless information, either way it is best to not leave any evidence you were there.
a good analogy of this would be an old cold war spy breaking into a house, taking pictures of important documents, and leaving without a trace.
A better analogy would be a drone flying into enemey airspace and looking at the army to try and get a gage of how strong their forces are.

##### Computer Network Attacks (CNA's)
computer network attacks are akin to traditional military attacks, or sabotage. It applies the four D's `Disrupt, Deny, Degrade, Destroy`.
if this were the analogies described in CNE, then it would be the Spy breaking artifacts as he left the house and introducing a gas leak so the house exploded. Or the drone would be intorduing hellfire from the airspace it was occupying.
However, the most commonly known types of CNA's are the `non-kinetic` CNA's. these are the attacks that damage through virtual causes, but have very real physical effects. if a spy were to remotely shut down the heating of a house during the coldest season of the year, this would mean the pipes within the house break. This is damaging for the residents of the house but the spy wasnts physically involved in shutting down the heating.

##### Computer Network Defence (CND)
these are the antiaircraft missiles to the drones, or the multiple locks ton the spy. The firewalls, security systems, radar sweeps, background checks, everything. This is what protects a network system from attacks and exploitation.

##### Computer Network Operations (CNO)
this is the umbrella term for attacks and defence in networks. This part of the the theory goes over the `non-kinetic` aspects of the network attacks and defences.

until it is no longer illegal to counterattack, CND and CNE are not directly related, and  not only that, CNE is a central point of network systems. Here is how it is defined by the US department:
```
Enabling operations and intelligence collections capabilities conducted through the ise of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or network.
	- Joint Publication 1-13
```
an important thing to take away from this definition is that there is always a target in mind. Famous viruses like `Michaelangelo, Code Red, Melissa, SQL Slammer` are worms and virusses that were aimlessly shot towards anyone that received them. that means none of these would be CNE's because they don't retrieve information froml a specified target.
worms and virusses are like the flu, anyone who receives them are just a victim, and received it due to bad defences, no knowledge of the enemy and bad luck.
However, there are targetted, wormlike attacks such as `stuxnet` that was designed and created to infiltrate iranian nuclear powestations, and was also able to create backdoor's in the linux kernle.

### Operations
CNE operations refer to the process of narrowing down your target and clearly identifying what it is you are aiming to acquire. there are certain definitions for certain words in a CNE job, however the word `target` has been left with dual meanings for a purpose. A target can be a computer network, a computer, an employee, a file system. All of these can be one in the same when on a reconaissonce job. Typically you have 2 `targets` you're interested in, the `goal target`, being the thing you want to get out of all of this work, and the `target obstacles` which is whatever is in your way to getting that information.
`computers` have a different meaning when it comes to a CNE attack or defense. A `computer` is just a device that holds data. When you are defencding or someone is attacking, the computers don't take sides, much like a chessboard doesnt take sides of the pieces. A computer is simply a platform for you to work on.
a `Network` is any connection of computer systems, it is bothh the computer and network devices. Network devices are essentially anything that allow it's information to be shared with it's network OR somehting that changes the Data shared on a network. For example, an 802.11n wifi router, smart switches, DSL converters, WI-FI access points, etc. a `network` can be any number of connections, from a simole connection of 2 wired computers to a complicated jungle of millions of computers connected through satellites and across oceons.
A final definition worth mentioning is the `internet`, by definition, the `internet` is a connection of many computers that do not have a common controlling entity. when running a CNE mission, an attacker doesnt care about the entire `internet`, but just with the attackers network. the `internet` is a series of contradictions: simultaneously concentrated and dispersed, interconnected and segmented, and established but under constant change.
