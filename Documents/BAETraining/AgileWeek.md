#### Enterprise Architecture and Project Frameworks

<u>What is an Enterprise?</u>

As consultants we will be speaking to non-technical people. Key understanding of whats being communicated are:

>  **Data** - Information without context
>
> **Information** - Data without meaning
>
> **Knowledge** - The use of information

**Business'** and **Enterprises** are people whole sell services and/or products to an organization.

<u>Deciding on a strategy</u>

<u>what is Enterprise Change</u>

All goes should be:
<u>S</u>pecific
<u>M</u>measurable
<u>A</u>chievable
<u>R</u>ealistic
<u>T</u>time managed

As consultants  we need to be able to be self critical and transform the bussines targets to their ideal targets.

 "IT systems should support the process; not the other way around"

<u>Why we use frameworks</u>

- Best practice
- Developed by experts
- Contains useful models & guidance
- increases "maturity"
- Promotes common understanding
- Time saving
- Adapt and Adopt
